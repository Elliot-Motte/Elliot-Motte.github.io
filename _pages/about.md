Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at University Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain and my research focuses on various topics in applied microeconomics. I am particularly interested in political economy, media economics and machine learning methods for text analysis.
Prior to starting a Ph.D. in 2020, I obtained a M.Sc. in economics and data science from ENSAE Paris (France).
