Welcome to my website, I am happy you came to visit!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at University Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain.

I am an applied microeconomist interested in political economy, media economics and machine learning methods for text analysis.

You can find more details about my research and background in my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/66kwbsom7ucoxjh/CV_Elliot_Motte.pdf?dl=0).
